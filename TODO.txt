- purge wisdom of stale render_cache entries (i.e. if pages move or get deleted)
- TODO enforce 1 of taxonomy type or something
- new cmd to create dentmark content templates

- tax descriptions/body in summary list


- split out custom tagdefs from generic ones
- even better handling of parent tag defs... it's getting really annoying havig to enumaret every possibility of nesting/child combinations


# maybe a big change/refactor in the future would be to add the ability to use entirely different TagSets
# for different types (basically Hugo's notion of a archetype or whatever)

- animated gifs are getting converted to non-animated png. Maybe keep file type the same or bypass pillow if .gif?

- promote to p -> common enough operation... make this a class property or method?


- enforce entry has at least one type as taxonomy
- set per_page to 25 or something reasonable when finished testing
- new command line command that lists all of the taxonomies in alphabetical order commented out (archlinux mirror style)
- differentiate betwen slugs and www... in url tag, to avoid confusion or broken links in case forgetting leading slash

- popular posts (maybe manually update this, or maybe it comes from blog tools?)



TDOO (eventually)... specify tagset or achetype in meta rather than taxonomy... determine required tags from that

TODO: maybe implement date archive on subsites (should this add subsite pages to main date archive, or a separate date archive for each subsite?
TODO: make sure date_archive tag for subsite config is not allowed for now until we figure this out

title/description - maybe need to 'decorate' text in these (i.e. 'fancy' quotes). They don't get rendered like other textnode text, and currently, the raw text is used.

TODO: maybe only list top X topics, with link to ALL or MORE

on transvec.com, make indentgen redirect to -> indentgen/


TODO: add featured image to OG opengraph tags
